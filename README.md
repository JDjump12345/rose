# Rose OS  

Rose OS is a custom Ubuntu-based Linux distribution created as a birthday gift for my friend. It is currently in development and will continue to receive updates even after their birthday.  

The first ISO release is planned for before  August 12. If itâ€™s not available by then, I might have had to step backâ€”but the goal is to keep pushing forward, learning, and improving along the way!  

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
